# Atari XL/XE Flight Over Unknown Land 256-byte intro

## Overview

This is the full assembler code for the Atari XL/XE Flight Over Unknown Land (FOUL) 256-byte intro by Kane/Suspect.
It can be assembled using MADS and has been written using the Atari Atasm plugin for VS Code.

The original idea had been to try to squeeze a Mandelbrot fractal into 256b but that appeared to be not doable due to the amount of computations involved. This is the result of playing around with the original base function with the aim of making it simpler and faster while still fairly intesresting in terms of its graphical repersentation.
